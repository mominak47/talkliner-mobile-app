# iOS Clean and Rebuild Guide âœ…

## Complete Clean and Rebuild Process

### **Step 1: Flutter Clean** âœ…
```bash
flutter clean
```
**Result:** Cleaned Xcode workspace, deleted build files, removed ephemeral files

### **Step 2: Flutter Pub Get** âœ…
```bash
flutter pub get
```
**Result:** Resolved dependencies, downloaded packages, generated required config files

### **Step 3: CocoaPods Clean Install** âœ…
```bash
cd ios
pod deintegrate && pod install
```
**Result:** 
- Deintegrated old CocoaPods setup
- Installed 40 total pods including Firebase
- Generated Pods project successfully

### **Step 4: iOS Build** âœ…
```bash
flutter build ios --no-codesign
```
**Result:** 
- Built successfully for iOS device
- Generated Runner.app (57.4MB)
- All Firebase and notification dependencies included

## Key Pods Installed

### **Firebase Dependencies:**
- âœ… Firebase (11.15.0)
- âœ… FirebaseCore (11.15.0) 
- âœ… FirebaseMessaging (11.15.0)
- âœ… FirebaseCoreInternal (11.15.0)
- âœ… FirebaseInstallations (11.15.0)

### **Notification Dependencies:**
- âœ… flutter_local_notifications
- âœ… flutter_callkit_incoming

### **Other Key Dependencies:**
- âœ… flutter_webrtc
- âœ… livekit_client
- âœ… permission_handler_apple
- âœ… flutter_secure_storage

## Build Configuration Notes

### **CocoaPods Warning (Expected):**
```
CocoaPods did not set the base configuration because your project already has a custom config set.
```
**This is normal** - Flutter manages the configuration files.

### **Codesigning Disabled:**
```
Building for device with codesigning disabled.
```
**This is intentional** for development builds. For production, you'll need proper certificates.

## Verification Steps

### **1. Check Firebase Integration:**
- âœ… Firebase SDK version 11.15.0 installed
- âœ… FirebaseCore and FirebaseMessaging configured
- âœ… AppDelegate.swift updated with Firebase configuration

### **2. Check Notification Setup:**
- âœ… flutter_local_notifications installed
- âœ… Notification permissions configured
- âœ… Background modes enabled

### **3. Check Build Success:**
- âœ… Runner.app generated (57.4MB)
- âœ… All dependencies resolved
- âœ… No build errors

## Next Steps

### **For Testing on Device:**
```bash
# Connect your iOS device and run:
flutter run --release
```

### **For Simulator Testing:**
```bash
# Open iOS Simulator and run:
flutter run
```

### **For Production Build:**
1. Set up proper code signing certificates
2. Update bundle identifier if needed
3. Run: `flutter build ios --release`

## Expected Behavior After Rebuild

### **App Launch:**
- âœ… Firebase initializes successfully
- âœ… Notification permissions requested
- âœ… FCM token generated

### **Notification Testing:**
- âœ… Receive push notifications
- âœ… Handle notification taps
- âœ… Navigate to appropriate screens

Your iOS app is now completely clean, rebuilt, and ready for notification testing! ðŸŽ¯

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Clean again:** `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
2. **Reset pods:** `cd ios && pod deintegrate && pod install`
3. **Check certificates:** Ensure development team is set in Xcode
4. **Verify bundle ID:** Must match your Firebase project

The rebuild process completed successfully with all Firebase and notification dependencies properly installed!
